A passionate full-stack web developer, I combine technical expertise and creativity to design modern, efficient and intuitive web solutions. Specialized in Laravel, Vue.js, PHP, Tailwind CSS and WordPress, I have collaborated on various projects, ranging from showcase websites to high-performance web applications for businesses and individuals. My journey has allowed me to master the entire development process, from initial design to final deployment, while ensuring an optimal user experience. What sets me apart: Technical skills: An in-depth knowledge of back-end and front-end technologies, combined with a sensitivity for UX/UI design. Successful projects: I have worked on projects such as NH High School, a school management application, or Glory's Nails, an elegant website for a women's beauty salon. Continuous learning: Passionate about innovation, I spend time learning new technologies and techniques to constantly improve my skills. My approach: My goal is to solve complex problems with simple, elegant and functional solutions, whether for a startup seeking visibility or an established company looking to optimize its performance. Through these processes, I strive to offer personalized services tailored to each need. When I'm not coding, I enjoy activities like rollerblading, reading inspiring manga or creating graphic designs.",
